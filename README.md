## Usage

Clone repository onto your personal machine and navigate to the `qualifier` directory via CLI. A *.py* file named `app.py` will be present. With *Python 3.7*+, run the following command in the CLI,

```
python app.py
```

After launching the above command, you will be prompted to enter a path to a *.csv* file containing loan information from a selection of banks. This file in question is located in `/qualifier/data/daily_rate_sheet.csv`. When this prompt arises, enter in the following as the path input:

```
./data/daily_rate_sheet.csv
```

 Next, you will be prompted to enter in a selection of financial information to determine any qualifying loans available to you. **All numerical data is assumed to be in U.S. Dollars (USD). Do not use commas or dollar signs when inputting data!**

Your qualifying loans are now available and you will be prompted with a message indicating the number of available loans from `daily_rate_sheet.csv`. Lastly, you will be given the option to save this information into a *.csv* format. If you choose to save your loan information, it will be stored in the following directory:

```
/qualifier/data/output
```
